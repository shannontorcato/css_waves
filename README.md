# CSS Waves

Created a simple page with waves as dividers. Used SVG generator like [Haikei](https://haikei.app/) and an online SVG code generator tool like [Shape Divider App](https://www.shapedivider.app/) 
to create the SVG element.

## Initial Wave
The first wave was created using CSS only but it proved to be troublesome and a pain. Changing one element in the CSS lead to other elements being out of place and make the whole
structure fall apart.

## Solution to the problem
An easy and flexible fix is to use online SVG generators like [Haikei](https://haikei.app/) and [Shape Divider App](https://www.shapedivider.app/).
With Haikei you use a .svg file in your project and basic CSS to add the finishing touches. Whereas with Shape Divider App, you can generator a code online for HTML and CSS 
and just copy and paste into it your project file.

This helped speed up the process and created an easy workflow to created beautiful Shape Dividers for webpages.
